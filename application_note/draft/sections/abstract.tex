\textbf{Motivation:} Dynamic Systems have proved to be a major tool in modelling 
and understanding biological processes and chemical reactions. The reconstruction of system 
states under statistical errors using e.g. Kalman Filters and Particle Filters is a long 
discussed topic. 
However serious issues a likely to occur as soon as the the underlying systems equations 
contain systematic error, e.g. unknown interactions. The R package \textsf{seeds} provides 
two algorithms that aim a numerical estimation of systematic model and simultaneously estimate 
the system states. \\
